During this crisis in particular, their monthly active users (MAU) has grown to over 11 million -- but they have yet to receive any large donations from the big companies to help pay for their servers and staff. In other words, they're struggling! We hope to change that with both direct contributions from our tickets sales and encouragement of our attendees & sponsors to donate what they can."
